# Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms

Assignments and implementations covering core data structures and problem-solving patterns in **Java**.

**Tech Stack:** Java • Performance Optimization • Algorithmic Logic

## What this repository demonstrates
- Strong CS fundamentals for reasoning about code behavior
- Implementing and analyzing data structures used in real systems
- Writing correct, testable implementations

### Project Highlights for Production Support:
* **Performance Optimization:** Analyzed time and space complexity (Big O) to select efficient data structures, essential for optimizing slow-running applications.
* **Complex Logic:** Solved algorithmic challenges that require breaking down large problems into solvable steps, the core of Incident Triage.
* **Data Handling:** managed complex data flows using trees, graphs, and hashmaps.

## Topics covered (typical)
- Trees (BST/AVL), heaps/priority queues
- Hash tables, graphs
- Searching/sorting, complexity analysis (Big-O)
- Recursion and algorithmic problem-solving patterns

## Why it matters for Production Support
Understanding data structures helps when diagnosing performance bottlenecks, memory behavior, and unexpected application behavior.
